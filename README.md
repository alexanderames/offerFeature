Ibotta Dev Project

# The Project
---

__Task 1__ Download Denver 311 service request [data](http://data.denvergov.org/download/gis/311_service_requests/csv/311_service_requests.csv). This data set contains events in the City and County of Denver for the previous 12 months.

__Task 2__ Explore the data to find interesting patterns or trends. The types of questions you might ask include the following:

- Are there seasonal trends to the different types of events?
- Which types of events are more common in which geographic areas (defined by coordinates or neighborhood)?
- How long are typical response/resolution times? Do these differ by type of event, geography, or other factors?

__Task 3__ Provide a user-facing front-end to assist in exploring the insights you generated. This can take any of the following formats:

- Web visualization (using, e.g., [d3](http://d3js.org/) or [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/))
- API that returns events for specific queries. Example endpoints could return, for example:
  - All events that fall within a radius
  - All events for a certain time range
  - All events of a certain type
- iPython notebook or other interactive, reproducible script

For some of these tasks you may find it easier to put the data into a database.

Treat your code as if it will be used in production to deliver insights to users. Think about readability and maintainability, and consider automated testing of code wherever possible.


# Deliverable
---
Please provide the code for the assignment either in a private repository (GitHhub or Bitbucket) or as a zip file. If you have a deliverable that can be deployed on the web please provide a link.
